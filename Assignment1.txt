For this assignment I tried ad hoc testing as well as unit testing with specific values passed in
I made sure to print the results of the test and added it as a menu option in my main menu. 
The menu will randomly pick one of the unit tests to run and output the results. 

I have experience with C++ but it's always good to go back to the basics and fundementals. 
I think going forward, I'd like to incorporate this assignment into a GUI. I've looked at a few 
and right now I'm leaning towards IMGUI which is one I've heard about before. I think 
it'll be a good way to challenge myself going forward.
